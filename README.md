# Heterogeneous Multilayer Generalized Operational Perceptron
ArXiv: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05093.pdf

Short description: We proposed an algorithm that learns compact network topologies using Generalized Operational Perceptron, originally proposed in [Progressive Operational Perceptron](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231216312851). The algorithm works by progressively adding neurons in a hidden layer or constructing new hidden layer. For the newly added neurons, both the operator set and the synaptic weights are optimized. In our experiments, we showed that our approach learned very compact networks in most cases while being highly accurate compared to other related algorithms [1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.08177), [2](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7987745/), [3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231216312851). 

Source code
===========

The source code of this project has been integrated into our new python package called [PyGOP](https://github.com/viebboy/PyGOP) that implements various GOP-based algorithms.
